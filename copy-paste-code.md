## Instructions 
1. Create a new branch, name it something like "multiplication". Once the branch has been created, copy the following code and place it inside of Calculator.java
2. Commit, push and publish the code, then change back over to your main branch. 
3. Once you are on your main branch, perform the following steps:
    - If you're using Github Desktop: 
        - Find the "Merge into **main**" alternative in your menu. 
        - Choose your new branch and press "create a merge commit"
        - Follow the instructions

public class Calculator {
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public double subtract(double a, double b) {
        return a - b;
    }

    public double multiply(double a, double b) {
        return a * b;
    }
}
